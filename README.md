# Smart Contracts Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini projects showcasing smart contracts developed using [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/).

## Projects

1. **Event Organization**: A simple smart contract which provides users to create events, buy tickets, and transfer tickets.
2. **Lottery Application**: A lottery smart contract which provides a transparent and fair way for participants to participate in a lottery or raffle-like game.

Each project is organized in its own directory and includes the necessary Solidity contract files, deployment scripts, and relevant documentation.

## Prerequisites

To run and interact with the smart contracts, you will need the following:

- [Solidity Compiler](https://soliditylang.org/docs/installing-solidity.html)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) (or any Ethereum development blockchain)
- [Truffle Suite](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) (optional, for deployment and testing)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the project's documentation.
3. Compile the Solidity contracts using the Solidity Compiler.
4. Deploy the contracts to your development blockchain (e.g., Ganache) using Truffle or any other deployment tool.
5. Interact with the deployed contracts by executing transactions or calling functions.

Please refer to the individual project's documentation for detailed instructions on how to run, test, and interact with each specific smart contract.
